## Predicting Customer Churn Project

Welcome to the Predicting Customer Churn project repository! In this project, we aim to develop a classification model to accurately predict customers who are likely to churn from a large online store.

### Background:
A large online store has approached us with a significant challenge: retaining customers. With a non-returning customer rate of around 90%, the company is in urgent need of a solution to identify and prevent customer churn.

### Project Objectives:
1. **Build a Classification Model**: Develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer churn.
2. **Identify Reasons for Churn**: Provide insights into the factors influencing customer churn and reasons why customers may not return.
3. **Recommendation Strategies**: Suggest strategies and interventions based on model findings and academic literature on customer retention and churn prevention.

### Key Highlights:
- **Model Development**: Developed a classification model with an AUC of 0.75 to forecast customer churn using various algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and SVM.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented data preprocessing techniques including normalization, outlier detection, and handling missing values to enhance model performance.

### Repository Contents:
- **R Scripts**: Contains scripts used for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Data Files**: Includes the test and train dataset used for analysis.
- **Executive Summary Pdf**: Presenting the findings to the executive board of the online store.

Feel free to explore the code, notebooks, and model files to gain insights into predicting customer churn. Contributions and feedback are always appreciated!
